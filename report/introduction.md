Implementation
==============

- Block diagram?
- Systems, physics, etc
- Mathematics
- Predict its behaviour?
- Evidence in time/freq analysis?
- Validate the model
- Present results

Extras
======

You should then discuss any of the enhancements or additional extras you have added to expand the range of sounds your model is capable of producing. Finally, present your sound design example presets, discuss their sonic content and demonstrate what your system is capable of. Conclude your article with a complete evaluation of what you have achieved and what might be the next steps for this next-generation synthesizer

Evaluation & Further Steps
==========================

Further to the 'systems' approach, it would be useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the convolution approach to generate the instrument body. Would it be more effective to model the body more fully? That way things could be parameterised. In the case of this model, an IR from a Taylor acoustic guitar is being used to model the body. Sticking with the convolution approach, it was intended before to utilise an anechoic chamber to record an IR from within the body of the reference bouzouki that was used when designing the synthesiser. Unfortunately this was not managed to be organised in the constraints of time available when accounting for other projects.
